# Campaign Naming Convention SOP
## For Market-Based Reporting in the Marketing Dashboard

---

## Purpose

This document outlines the required naming conventions for Google Ads and Meta Ads campaigns to enable accurate market-based filtering and reporting in the dashboard.

---

## Naming Requirements

For the Market Filter to correctly identify and segment campaigns, **include one of the following identifiers** in your campaign name:

| Market | Accepted Identifiers | Examples |
|--------|---------------------|----------|
| **Ireland** | `IRE`, `IE`, `Ireland` | `Brand - IRE - Awareness`, `IE-Prospecting-Q1`, `Ireland Summer Sale` |
| **United Kingdom** | `UK`, `United Kingdom`, `Britain`, `British` | `Brand - UK - Conversions`, `UK-Retargeting-Q1`, `British Spring Campaign` |

---

## Formatting Rules

### 1. Use Separators Around Market Codes

Use spaces or hyphens to separate the market code from other words:

✅ **Correct:**
- `Campaign - IE - Awareness`
- `UK-Prospecting-2024`
- `Brand IE Conversions`

❌ **Incorrect:**
- `CampaignIEAwareness` (no separator - will not be detected)

### 2. Position Flexibility

The market code can appear anywhere in the campaign name:

- **Beginning:** `IE - Brand Campaign`
- **Middle:** `Brand - UK - Conversions`
- **End:** `Summer Sale - IRE`

### 3. Case Insensitive

The system recognizes market codes regardless of case:
- `IE`, `ie`, `Ie` — all work the same
- `UK`, `uk`, `Uk` — all work the same

---

## Examples

| Campaign Name | Detected Market |
|--------------|-----------------|
| `ActiveIron - IE - Brand Awareness` | Ireland ✅ |
| `UK-Retargeting-Iron Supplements` | United Kingdom ✅ |
| `Ireland Prospecting Q1 2024` | Ireland ✅ |
| `British Summer Campaign` | United Kingdom ✅ |
| `Brand Campaign 2024` | ⚠️ No market detected |

## Important Notes

- ⚠️ Campaigns **without** a market identifier will only appear when "All Markets" is selected in the dashboard
- 📊 Consistent naming across both Google Ads and Meta Ads ensures unified reporting
- 🔄 Apply this convention to **new campaigns** and consider renaming existing campaigns for historical accuracy
- 📅 Changes to campaign names take effect immediately in the dashboard after the next data refresh

---

## Recommended Naming Structure

For consistency, we recommend the following naming structure:

```
[Brand] - [Market] - [Objective] - [Audience/Creative] - [Date/Version]
```

**Examples:**
- `ActiveIron - IE - Awareness - Cold Audience - Q1 2024`
- `ActiveIron - UK - Conversions - Retargeting - Feb 2024`
